# BiblioSmith Launcher Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build a production-quality cross-platform BiblioSmith Launcher desktop app that checks and updates this repository and the OpenCode Desktop client.

**Architecture:** Tauri owns filesystem, Git, update download, installer launch, and autostart integration. React owns the polished user interface, local settings, visible update status, commit scroll area, and activity log. The user-facing launcher directory contains the setup executable at the top level and keeps development files under `source/`.

**Tech Stack:** Tauri 2, React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Rust, reqwest, tauri-plugin-autostart.
